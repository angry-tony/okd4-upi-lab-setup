# Installing OKD4.X with User Provisioned Infrastructure. Libvirt, iPXE, and FCOS

## I have written this from my own lab configuration. I am doing clean runs in another environment, and will continue to push fixes and clarifications as I encounter issues.  Open issues if you encounter problems.  I am sure there are still plenty of bugs.  

### If you created a fork of this project, you will want to re-sync with this repository.  I am fixing issues while testing, and adding new features.  

Read the [Tutorial on GitHub Pages](https://cgruver.github.io/okd4-upi-lab-setup/)
